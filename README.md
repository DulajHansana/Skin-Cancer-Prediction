# Skin-Cancer-Prediction

<h3>You can predict the skin cancer between benign and malignant.</h3>
<p>This repository contains a project focused on predicting skin cancer using machine learning techniques. The project utilizes a dataset sourced from Kaggle, and it is implemented in Python with the use of iPython (Jupyter Notebook).</p>

<h3>Overview</h3>
<P>Skin cancer is a common and potentially life-threatening condition if not detected early. This project aims to build a predictive model that can help in early detection by classifying skin lesions into different categories, such as benign or malignant. The dataset used contains images and other relevant data for training the model.</P><br>

<h3>Project Structure</h3>
